/**
 * Repository RPC calls route through the factory's bounded, self-healing `callResult`
 * (which delegates to [com.calypsan.listenup.client.data.remote.RpcProxyCache.rpcCall]) — never a
 * hand-rolled `try/catch` that folds a raw `service.method()` result itself.
 *
 * The bounded engine is the whole point of the seam: a transport death heals invisibly (one bounded
 * reconnect + retry), a surviving fault surfaces as a typed `AppResult.Failure`, a `TransportError.
 * Timeout` bounds a hung frame, and a lost-response frame becomes an honest timeout rather than a
 * silent hang. A repository that instead opens the raw proxy (`factory.fooService()`) and wraps it
 * in its own `when (result) { Success/Failure }` fold gets none of that — it is a "never stranded"
 * gap hiding behind a green compile.
 *
 * **The tell.** Every hand-rolled repo aliases the contract result type as
 * `import com.calypsan.listenup.api.result.AppResult as WireAppResult` so it can spell out the
 * `WireAppResult.Success`/`WireAppResult.Failure` fold by hand. Canonical repos
 * ([com.calypsan.listenup.client.data.repository.ShelfRepositoryImpl],
 * [com.calypsan.listenup.client.data.repository.CollectionRepositoryImpl], and now
 * `GenreRepositoryImpl`) carry no such alias — they call `factory.callResult { it.method() }` and
 * let the boundary fold the outcome. So the alias is a precise, uniform proxy for the drift.
 *
 * This rule is a ratchet: it locks the migrated surface and blocks NEW hand-rolled repos. The
 * [RESIDUAL_HANDROLLED_RPC_ALLOWLIST] holds the repos still awaiting migration — the project is
 * rewritten in place, so each entry drops off the list the day its `callResult` migration ships
 * (as `GenreRepositoryImpl` just did). Removing a file from the set is the explicit signal that one
 * of those re-touches has landed; adding one should never be necessary.
