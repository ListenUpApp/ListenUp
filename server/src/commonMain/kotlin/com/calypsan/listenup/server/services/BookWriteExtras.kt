/**
 * Per-write extras the scan/edit paths inject into [BookRepository.writePayload] via the
 * coroutine context. Replaces shared-mutable maps: scoped to the call, no cross-book race.
 *
 * The consumer — the SQLDelight base's non-suspend `writePayload`, which runs synchronously inside
 * `suspendTransaction { db.transactionWithResult { … } }` — cannot read the suspend-only
 * `coroutineContext`. So callers install the extras with `withContext(TransactionLocal(extras)) { … }`:
 * [suspendTransaction][com.calypsan.listenup.server.db.sqldelight.suspendTransaction] mirrors the
 * carried value onto whatever thread the transaction body runs on (after the `sqlIoDispatcher` hop),
 * and `writePayload` reads it back via [current] with no suspension and no cross-coroutine race.
